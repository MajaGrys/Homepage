# Portfolio

This portfolio presents my skills and the projects I have completed. The website has been created during a 2-week internship in collaboration with my mentor.

During the development of this project we have used React, React Router, Typescript and Chakra UI. Users can use a contact form to send me a message, the backend of which is handled using [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/). Additionally, a chatbot has been implemented using [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), however, it no longer works due to the end of the free period.
